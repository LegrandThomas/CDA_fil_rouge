This version control feature provides a safety net for your notes, allowing you to experiment and adjust without worry.

Additionally, you can organize your notes into different notebooks, making it simple to find what you need. 
This organization feature helps you categorize your notes in a way that makes sense to you, whether by project, topic, or any other method you prefer.
